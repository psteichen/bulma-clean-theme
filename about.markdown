This site is about me and my private as well as para-professional activities.

### Why _libre.lu_ ?

Well, _libre_ shall be considered as in [Libre Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_knowledge) or in [Libre software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_knowledge), because knowledge, and its implementation: software is really only useful if it is easily accessible and useable. The basis of this being the **4 freedoms**:

0. use the work for any purpose
1. study its mechanisms, to be able to modify and adapt it to their own needs
2. make and distribute copies, in whole or in part
3. enhance and/or extend the work and share the result
